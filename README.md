# os-dev
Code for operating system using assembly and C. 

# Strategy

We will want to do many things with our OS:

 - Boot from scratch, without GRUB - DONE!
 - Enter 32-bit mode - DONE
 - Jump from Assembly to C - DONE!
 - Interrupt handling - DONE!
 - Screen output and keyboard input
 - A tiny, basic libc which grows to suit our needs
 - Memory management
 - Write a filesystem to store files
 - Create a very simple shell
 - User mode
 - Maybe we will write a simple text editor
 - Multiple processes and scheduling
